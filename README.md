# What is this:
This repo contains the list of all the apps/tools that I usually install on a new mac for software development

# note:
you still need alfred, avast security, google chrome, iterm2, karabiner elements, sequel-pro, spectacle, VSCode-darwin, SmootherScrollForVsCode
for the SmootherScrollForVsCode
copy the smoothscroll dir to
$HOME/.vscode/extensions
some times you need to compile the extentions first
